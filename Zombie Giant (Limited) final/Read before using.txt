Before playing in a map, you have to config the spawn points for that map otherwise boss will get stuck on spawn.
This is a useful plugin that allows you to do that: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=371317

For each map, you need: '32 CT Spawnpoints' and '5 T Spawnpoints' (CT = Human, T = Boss). Make each T spawnpoint far to each other
Also, somemaps like 'awp map' may cause crash to the server, not the plugin... Don't be misunderstand

Just compile all sma files and run the server. If you feel the gameplay is unbalanced, you can open sma and set something like:
- Boss Base Health (Boss HP = Base HP * Player Number) (EX: Base HP 1000 , 3 Players, -> 3 x 1000 = 3000HP)
- Boss Speed (each boss has different speed)
- If you don't feel 5 minutes per round good, you can change to 3, 6, 9 or 10
- Boss skill damages: Each skill has a damage, you can change it to make your server balance or just leave it default

Also there is a lang file, you can translate it, but do it carefully or it may cause problem
When you are installing the mod, remember to add 'gamemaster' in modules.ini

I also attach a map 'zm_x3', i think you can play in this map.
